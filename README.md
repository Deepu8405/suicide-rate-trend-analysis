# Global Suicide Rate Trend Analysis 📊

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global suicide rates to uncover patterns related to geography, gender, age groups, and socio-economic factors.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To identify significant trends in suicide rates across different demographics and time periods, providing data-driven insights into a critical global health issue.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
* **Language:** Python [cite: 23]
* **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Manipulation), NumPy (Numerical Analysis), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization), Scikit-learn (Statistical Modeling) [cite: 24, 25]

## 🔍 Key Insights
* **Demographic Trends:** Analysis of which age groups and genders are most at risk globally.
* **Economic Correlation:** Investigating the relationship between GDP per capita and suicide rates.
* **Temporal Analysis:** Tracking how rates have evolved over the last few decades.

## 📂 Dataset
The analysis is based on the [World Health Organization (WHO)] dataset (or specify Kaggle if applicable [cite: 5]).
